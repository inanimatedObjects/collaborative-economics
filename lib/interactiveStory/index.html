                                <li>Collective economies can be represented as marketplaces where consumers rely on each other instead of large companies to meet their wants and needs. Collaborative economies consist of giving, swapping, borrowing, trading, renting, and sharing products and services for a fee, between an individual who has something and an individual who needs something â€” generally with the help of a web-based middleman. A collaborative economy may also be known as a "shared economy," "sharing economy" or a "peer-to-peer economy."</li>

                                        <li>Sharing economies allow individuals and groups to make money from underused assets. In this way, physical assets are shared as services</li>
                                        <li>The "sharing economy", "collaborative economy" and "access economics" are frequently used interchangably to generally describe collective economics-based systems,  with each term's respective distinctions used for subclassification purposes.</li>
